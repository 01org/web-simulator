	<h1>Introduction of Demo Applications</h1>
	This <a href="video.html" target="new">demo video</a> shows a quick
	go-through of every demo application. Each demo application is briefly
	presented in the following paragraphs.

	<h2>Accelerometer</h2>
	<p>Accelerometer API can access accelerometer sensor values and
		functionalities are provided via deviceapis.accelerometer interface.</p>

	<p>Application can subscribe to accelerometer device to receive
		notifications about device acceleration changes.</p>

	<p>X,Y and Z Axis values are show in the middle and when you can
		click and drag with mouse, those value will change concurrently.</p>

	<p>Also, we can click the "Shake" button to simulate the device is
		shaken along the X axis.</p>

	<h2>Device Orientation</h2>
	<p>This example simulates a device orientation change event.</p>

	<p>Switch between portrait and landscape icon from the Device
		panel, as you can see, the platform screen is rotated accordingly.</p>

	<h2>Device APIs</h2>
	This page shows the result of deviceapis.listAvailableFeatures() and
	deviceapis.listActivatedFeatures().

	<h2>Geo Positioning With Ripple</h2>
	<p>Geographical data can be configured from the "Geo Location"
		panel and web simulator will pass the geo location data to the
		application.</p>
	<p>As shown in the video, we change the value of Latitude from the
		"Geo Location" panel and the map in the panel is updated instantly for
		reference. Then click the "Update Map" button in our application, the
		map in the center is updated accordingly with correct geographical
		data, just like the map on the Geo Location panel.</p>

	<h2>Camera</h2>

	<p>The example shows the emulated camera window for the device.
		Click capture to take a picture or use "Record Start" and "Record
		Stop" to record video.</p>

	<h2>Device Interaction</h2>
	<p>This example demonstrates a few device notification mechanisms
		provided by WAC 2.0 DeviceInteraction API. As shown in the "Device &
		Network Setting", you can turn on/off device vibrator and backlight
		and adjust audio volume.</p>
	<p>If backlight is off, the whole device is dimmed to simulate this
		effect.</p>
	<p>One of the most prominent case of DeviceInteraction module is to
		test startNotify. If the device volume is above 0, a device beeper is
		played when startNotify is invoked. If the device volume is set to 0
		and vibrator is active, then the device will render a shake-like
		movement. If the vibrator is also off, backlight will be switched on
		for a specified duration.</p>
	<h2>Contact</h2>
	<p>This example demonstrates the usage of pim.contact API. Start by
		getting an Address Book and you can add/update/delete/find contacts in
		that Address Book.</p>

	<h2>Filesystem</h2>

	<p>Filesystem example showcases the capability of Filesystem API.
		You can traverse the file system hierarchy by clicking through the
		folders or back button. You can also execute copy/paste/delete
		operations by clicking corresponding buttons. In addition, a simple
		editor is provided for you to create/edit text files.</p>

	<h1>Tizen Simulator Features</h1>
	
	The features of the simulator are best demonstrated by loading the Tizen API Demo application.
	More to come... How to load demo app.  Screenshot

		<h2>Loading application URL</h2>
		<p>By default, we have provided a demo application for WAC 2.0
			API. The simulator will preload this demo application. To specify
			your own test program, please enter the url of your web application
			in the address bar at the top. (NOT the address bar of the browser).</p>

		<p>For example, if you have a test program at
			/home/tizen/demo/wac-api-test.html in your local machine. You just
			enter</p>
		<div id="code">
			<pre>"file:///home/tizen/demo/wac-api-test.html"</pre>
		</div>
		<p>in the address bar inside the simulator, as show in the pic
			below.</p>
		<img src="./images/wac2-address-bar.png" alt="">
		<p>
			or if it is a test page from a remote link, just enter the complete
			url, e.g. <i><b>http://specs.wacapps.net/1.0/dec2010/examples.html</b></i><b></b>
		</p>

		<h2>Basic panel operation</h2>
		<p>each panel can be moved around by click-hold the icon on the
			right hand side of the title bar as shown in pic below:</p>
		<img src="./images/wac2-move.png" alt="">
		<p>By clicking on the title bar area, the panel can be toggled
			between collapse/expand.</p>
		<br> <b>Device panel is expanded:</b><br> <img
			src="./images/wac2-expand.png" alt=""><br>
		<br> <b>Device panel is collapsed:</b><br> <img
			src="./images/wac2-collapse.png" alt="">


		<h2>Device Information and Event Trigger Panel</h2>
		<p>The panels on the right/left show device related information
			and simulate events to the device in the middle. In the following
			paragraphs, we will introduce them one by one.</p>
		<h3>Devices</h3>
		<img src="./images/Devices.png" alt="">

		<p>In this panel you can change the target device you are
			emulating. In addition, you can switch its orientation between
			portrait mode and landscape mode. If your application has subscribed
			to this event, it should receive the event and invoke corresponding
			callback.</p>
		<h3>Platforms</h3>
		<img src="./images/wac2-Platforms.png" alt="">
		<p>In this panel, you should be able to specify the platform you
			are on. Just select from the Platform and Version dropdown menu, and
			click "Change Platform".</p>
		<h3>Information</h3>
		<img src="./images/Information.png" alt="">
		<p>This panel gives you a view of what device your are simulating,
			which platform you are on, as well as notes that are of interest for
			the emulated environment.</p>

		<h3>Accelerometer</h3>
		<img src="./images/Accelerometer.png" alt="">
		<p>In this panel, you can click and drag with your mouse to
			manipulate the physical position of the device, which should be
			useful if your application is responding to accelerometer change. A
			"Shake" button is provide to simulate the back and forth movement
			along the X axis.</p>
		<h3>Settings</h3>
		<img src="./images/wac2-SimulatorSettings.png" alt="">
		<p>This panel provides a control panel the simulator's setting.
			You can turn on/off tooltip and choose simulator's dark/light theme.</p>
		<h3>Geo location</h3>

		<img src="./images/GeoLocation.png" alt="">
		<p>Your test application can use APIs to retrieve geographical
			data from the device and this panel provides a input interface to
			configure the geographical data being sent from the device.
			Additionally, a map is shown in response to the change of the data,
			so you get an idea of what the geo location data means in a real map.</p>
		<h3>Config</h3>
		<img src="./images/wac2-Config.png" alt="">
		<p>If a config.xml for your application is provided, simulator
			will try to parse and validate it. This section is just a graphical
			representation of your configuration file.</p>

		<h3>Device & Networking Settings</h3>

		<img src="./images/wac2-DeviceNetworkSettings.png" alt="">
		<p>WAC 2.0 provides various APIs to retrieve device and networking
			information. This panel allows user to specify device status and see
			if the application can react accordingly.</p>
		<p>In the Config section, you can turn on/off vibrator and
			backlight. Also, you can adjust audio volume. These notification
			mechanism can be controlled by deviceinteraction APIs.</p>
		<p>The rest part in this panel are device and network properties
			that can be configured and devicestatus APIs offers methods to get
			information about the device status and subscribe to receive
			notifications of device status changes.</p>
